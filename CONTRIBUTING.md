# What The Hell Am I Doing? How Do I Help Contribute?
Hey there. First off, **thank you for contributing!** This really helps the project out, so thank you thank you thank you.

*Now, what do you need to know?* **Not much!**

# The Basic Steps To Creating A Design Style Is As Follows:
1. fork this repo
2. create a folder named after the style your contributing in the `styles` folder
3. copy & paste the `index.html` file from the root directory into that folder
4. create & modify a `styles.css` file to style the content in the `index.html` file to fit your design style

**That's it!**
*Feel free to browse through the files in the `styles/minimalism` folder to get a feel of what you'll be doing.*

# What Is A "Design Style"?
You know [**material design**](https://material.io/design/)? Ever heard of [**minimalism**](https://visme.co/blog/minimalist-graphic-design/)? Ever seen those [**trendy blockchain-startup sites**](https://www.google.com/search?q=trendy+blockchain+site+design&sxsrf=ACYBGNScBv0fHOLeN2CWAf8iJUKePTMVaw:1570037999932&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI_JOqj_7kAhVR1qwKHQYdAmMQ_AUIEigB&biw=1600&bih=806)?

Yeah, *those*. Basically, a design style is just a set of aesthetics that you apply to your product / project to give it a bit of cohesive-visual-juice!

# What Kind Of Style Should I Create?
Whatever you feel like! Just make sure your not adding a style that's already submitted & approved.

# Any Restrictions On What I'm Allowed To Change & Style?
You can style whatever you'd like, however you'd like! The `index.html` file in the root directory includes comments in the code that detail what content should remain, and what you're free to change.

As for adding new content, I suggest you keep this to a minimum. Don't add to much additional text or paragraphs, the content should remain *mostly* the same from site to site.

# Any Restrictions On What I'm Allowed To Upload & Include In My Style Folder?
Whatever you need, but again, try keeping it to a minimum. Images can be linked to or included in your folder.

Javascript files are allowed, but only when neccessary for you style. Javascript frameworks are also allowed, but you're encouraged to try and keep your folder as slim & lightweight as possible!

# So... Just Look For A Design Syle, Create A Version Of This Site With It, And Submit A PR?
**You got it!**

# I'm A Little Confused Still...
Sure, no problem. Sorry if I'm not explaining this well enough. Open up a new Issue to start a discussion, or just hit me up on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/StuffBySpencer), I'll help out in any way I can :^)
